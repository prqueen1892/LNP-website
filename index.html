        <p>Living-N-Purpose is a Christian-based humanitarian organization dedicated to serving children, youth, and women in urban and rural communities across various nations with an initial concentration in Uganda. Our mission is to empower individuals and communities to live purposefully and make a positive impact through sustainable programs addressing spiritual, physical, and mental well-being.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> In collaboration with local stakeholders and community members, we provide tools, resources, and skills aimed at activating purpose both individually and collectively. Our holistic approach addresses current challenges faced by these communities, including poverty, lack of education, health disparities, and spiritual needs.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Our programs focus on areas such as education, healthcare, vocational training, spiritual development, and community empowerment. By fostering self-reliance and resilience, we believe in building communities that are capable of driving their own development and creating sustainable solutions to their challenges. Through our initiatives, we seek to not only alleviate immediate suffering but also lay the foundation for long-term transformation.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Living-N-Purpose was founded in 2019 by Nydia Cruz in response to the pressing needs observed across various nations with an initial concentration in Uganda. Nydia Cruz was born in New York City and is of Puerto Rican descent. She has traveled and served on mission trips across Guatemala, Peru, Colombia, Cuba, and Uganda.<p>

<p>She has served within her local churches with a passion for sharing the gospel through serving others, being Jesusâ€™s hands and feet. Nydia first went to Uganda in 2019 and knew immediately there was something different that transpired in Uganda and is relocating to serve the people of Uganda and travel wherever the Lord is calling her to.<p>

<p>Her passion is for people to see and know the love of Jesus that they may be transformed into who He has called them to be. She is a graduate of Antioch School of Urban Ministry, accredited through Biblical Life and College Seminary, and holds a Bachelors in Biblical Studies.</p>
